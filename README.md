Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm (Groceries Dataset)
The Market Basket Analysis project aims to uncover hidden patterns and associations among items frequently purchased together by customers. In the retail industry, understanding such relationships is essential for improving store layouts, designing effective promotional strategies, and recommending complementary products to enhance customer satisfaction and sales. This project applies data mining techniques to analyze large-scale transactional data using the Groceries Dataset.

The analysis is carried out using the Apriori algorithm, which identifies frequent itemsets and generates association rules based on key metrics such as support, confidence, and lift. The dataset, containing thousands of grocery transactions, is first preprocessed by grouping individual purchases into transactions and encoding them using TransactionEncoder. The Apriori algorithm from the mlxtend library is then applied to extract meaningful patterns of co-purchased products. These patterns are further visualized through scatter plots and network graphs using Matplotlib and NetworkX, allowing an intuitive understanding of product relationships.

The insights derived from the analysis reveal which products are commonly bought together, enabling retailers to make data-driven decisions in product placement, cross-selling, and bundle creation. For example, items like milk, bread, and butter may frequently co-occur, suggesting strategic placement near each other or combined discounts. Such actionable insights not only enhance marketing effectiveness but also improve the customer shopping experience and increase overall revenue.

Overall, this project demonstrates how Market Basket Analysis using Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms can transform raw transactional data into valuable business intelligence for the retail domain.
